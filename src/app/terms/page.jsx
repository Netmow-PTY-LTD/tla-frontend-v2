              funds provided to The Law App by the client on acceptance of an
              estimated quote by a lawyer and prior to the lawyer receiving
              their share of such agreed estimated quote. The lawyer is then
              obliged to provide a no obligation consultation with the client
              via telephone, online video or in person (as can be mutually
              agreed between the client and the lawyer) prior to final agreement
              on the estimated quote and engagement of the lawyer by the client.
              The funds are then apportioned to the lawyer in the percentage of
              90% to the lawyer and to The Law App in the percentage of 10%, as
              an administration fee.
              <br />
              15.4. Should a prospective client not agree to engage with a
              lawyer who has provided an agreed estimated quote, after the
              initial consultation with the lawyer. The Law App reserves its
              right to charge an administrative fee.
              <br />
              15.4. The Law App reserves the unrestricted right to determine and
              change any fees associated with usage of or access to the website

              provided. If however, an adjustment event arises in respect of the
              supply, the additional amount must be adjusted to reflect the
              adjustment event and you or The Law App (as the case may be) must
              make any payments necessary to reflect the adjustment.
              <br />
