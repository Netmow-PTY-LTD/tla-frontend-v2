                  Credits are the currency used within our platform to access
                  premium features and services. You can purchase credits
                  through various subscription plans or one-time payments. If
                  you see a job that you like and you want to get in contact
                  with that customer, then you use credits to purchase their
                  contact details (you will receive their personal phone number
                  and email address). The amount of credits required to contact
                  a customer varies depending on the potential value of the job
                  e.g. you will need less credits to contact a customer looking
                  for a cleaner once a month for a 1 bedroomed flat than a
                  customer looking for a cleaner once a week for a 5 bedroomed
                  house.

                  The starter pack is the only way to get started and trial
                  properly. It provides enough credits to contact roughly 10
                  customers and is designed so that you get hired at least once
                  and get a great return on your investment. We’re so confident
                  that you’ll get hired at least once from the starter pack that
                  we offer a full Get Hired Guarantee. We also offer a massive
                  20% discount off the standard price.
